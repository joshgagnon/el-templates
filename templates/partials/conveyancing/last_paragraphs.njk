        Please note that while we require a certified copy of your photo identification, we are happy to rely on an uncertified copy in the first instance, provided we meet you in person at least once during the matter.  This will most likely occur when we meet you to execute the documents required for the transaction.  At that meeting, we can take our own certified copy of your photo identification.
